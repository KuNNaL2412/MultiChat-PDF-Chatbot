# MultiChat-PDF-Chatbot

## Problem Statement:
Improving the User Interface of the PDF Chatbot Streamlit App(that was created in Task1/Task 2)
 
## Objective:
Enhance the existing Streamlit-based chatbot application to provide a more intuitive and user-friendly interface by adding features to store chat history and a new chat button.
 
## Description:
Your task is to improve the user interface of an existing PDF chatbot Streamlit application that integrates a chatbot, Langchain, and the OpenAI API for handling PDF uploads and answering questions. The current version of the app lacks the capability to store chat history and initiate new conversations easily.
 
Chat History- Implement a feature that displays the chat history on the left side of the app, allowing users to review previous interactions. The chat history should update in real-time as new messages are exchanged.
 
New Chat Button- Add a new chat button or similar user interface element that allows users to start a fresh conversation.
 
User Experience- Ensure that the new features are seamlessly integrated into the existing app and that user interactions (PDF uploads, questions, responses) remain functional and user-friendly.
